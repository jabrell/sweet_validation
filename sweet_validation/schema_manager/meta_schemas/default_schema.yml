  The default metadata schema for the standard registry. The default scheme
  requires tables to have a name property and fields. Fields are already required
  by the frictionless standard.
  The default scheme is used when no scheme is provided.
fields:
  - name: name
    type: string
    constraints:
      required: true
  - name: fields
    type: array
    constraints:
      required: true
